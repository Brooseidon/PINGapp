# PING!


An Android application, developed using Java and published on the Google Play Store, that "checks one's internet connection," or more specifically, checks one's internet connection to specific servers across the world. In other words, PING! sends a ping to a server/IP address and displays the time that it takes for that ping to return to the sender - therefore, "checking" one's internet connection to that server/IP address.


Built and developed in the summer of 2018 as a one person team
